This project is for a set of gears that can be attached with a magnet to 
a metal surface.

This set is intended to have the following gears glued together:
50/10
36/12
15/30
25/10

The donut-shaped pieces are glued to the disk-shaped ones to make a hub for
the gears.  On top (on the disk shaped piece) goes the larger disk.  Inside
the donut is a 1/4" neodymium magnet.
