Stuff here created using cad.py from MIT.

z min set to -0.005 (five mils).  z max at 0.01.

Under Windows should be able to send directly to Modela with (in command window)
	type whatever.rml > COM1

Or whatever com port the Modela is attached to.

Tool speed is either 1 or 4, specified in file (need to experiment, which speed
is safe for bit).

All done using 1 contour, and the largest bit where all traces are isolated.

The blinky PNG was exported from Eagle after setting the view layers to be only 
top, bottom, pads, and vias, resolution 500 dpi, monochrome.  The image had to
be inverted after opening in cad.py.
